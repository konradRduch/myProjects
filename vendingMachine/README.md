vending machine simulator

The project simulates the operation of a beverage vending machine. The machine can be operated by administrator and customer. The admin can take profits from the slot machine and refill the slot machine, customer can buy products from machine, put money into vending machine, collect change and drink. I created classes to write and read a file, a class that displays text in an aligned table, and its own list to store data.
