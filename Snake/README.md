Snake game

During the game, we play the role of a snake, we control it with the arrows. The snake moves left, right and forward 
in a limited area and speed. Apples appear on the board, if we manage to eat them, we gain a point and increase the 
size of our snake's tail. The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible. Running into a wall or a snake's 
tail ends the game. The application has a selection menu, we can select the game, options, record and exit the application.
The project is written in C++ using the SFML graphics library.
