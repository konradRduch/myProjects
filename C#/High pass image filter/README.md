A program for filtering images in bmp format using high-pass filters (Remove average, HP1, HP2 and HP3). I implemented an algorithm that makes the elements
high-frequency images are amplified and low-frequency elements are attenuated. For this purpose, I used functions written in C# and assembly language,
and I also implemented methods that count the execution time of the functions.
